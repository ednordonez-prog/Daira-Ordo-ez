    "For our Blackjack project, our goal is to build a simple version of the game using lists, loops, functions, and random card dealing. We started by creating a deck of 52 cards. Since the card values in Blackjack never change, we define the basic values first (2–10, face cards = 10, Ace = 11) and then repeat each value four times for the four suits. We store the whole deck in a list and shuffle it so the order is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the game begins, both the player and the dealer receive two cards each. we use lists to store the hands, because cards will be added during the round. To calculate the total, we add all the values together and then adjust Aces when necessary. If the total is above 21 and the hand contains Aces counted as 11, we convert them to 1 by subtracting 10. This prevents the player or dealer from busting too early.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player goes first. They can choose to “hit” or “stand,” and if they hit, we add another card to their hand. The loop continues until they stand or go over 21. After the player is done, the dealer takes their turn. The dealer must hit until they reach at least 17. Once both turns are finished, the game compares the totals: busts, wins, losses, and ties are all handled. Finally, the game prints the result and ends the round.\n",
    "\n",
    "This whole process happens inside the main function called play_game(), which calls all the other functions in the correct order. Oue functions follow a clear structure, creating the deck, dealing cards, calculating totals, running each turn, and determining the winner."
